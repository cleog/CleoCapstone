      "description": "Architectural engineering is the application of engineering fundamentals to the design of buildings and building systems.                   In the architectural engineering program, you'll have the chance to learn how to design buildings that are not only visually stunning but also safe, energy-efficient, and supportive of the health and well-being of those who occupy them. You'll gain a deep understanding of electrical, lighting, mechanical, and structural system and learn how building systems interact with each other. With a focus on sustainability and high-performance buildings, you'll be at the forefront of shaping the built environment for a better future. Upon graduation, you'll have highly sought-after skills and the ability to collaborate with architects, urban planners, and civil engineers to bring your visions to life.                   Students in Oregon State’s program — the only one in the Pacific Northwest — can concentrate on chosen architectural engineering sub-disciplines, such as lighting, mechanical systems, and structures. Graduates possess highly marketable skills that enable them to engineer sustainable and high-performance buildings that support the health of people and the planet.",
